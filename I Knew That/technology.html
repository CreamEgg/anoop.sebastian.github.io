                <div class="card-image image45"></div>
                <p>When your girlfriend insists on friending you on Facebook and you’re not for the idea, she may be trying to salvage your relationship – well, and marking her territory, of course. The social networking site has been blamed for rising cases of marital fallouts.</p>

                <div class="card-image image46"></div>
                <p>Would you believe Google wanted to cash in for $1 million in its early days? True, and what’s also true is that no one was interested in buying it. One company that stepped forth was Excite, and the CEO at the time, George Bell, said he wasn’t willing to pay a million dollars for the search engine. He haggled with the search engine’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to bring the price down to $750,000, but he ended up rejecting that offer as well!</p>

                <p>Did you know what the word ‘Siri’ means in Swahili? It means secret. But this is not the case with Apple’s Siri app, because, Big Brother is listening. Whenever you whisper to Siri, everything you say ends up on the tech giant’s servers. Apple revealed that the voice prompts are stored for as long as two years.</p>

                <p>The likes of instant messaging may be growing in use, but short messaging service, otherwise known as SMS, still carries the bulk of mobile interactions. It would help matters if we pointed out that the 6-billion figure is consumption by American mobile users only. Astounding, right?</p>

                <p>Kim Dotcom had not just been jet-setting around the globe, or amazing new sports cars, or just hanging out with Bruce Willis.

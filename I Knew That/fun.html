            	<h1>Chewing gum can actually raise your metabolic rate by about 20%</h1>
                <div class="card-image image32"></div>
                <p>Chewing gum may be regarded by many as an unpleasant habit only seen in teenagers. For centuries, though, people of different backgrounds have been enjoying gum. And this is one habit that is unlikely to die out any time soon. Aside from being a boredom killer, memory enhancer and stress reducer, chewing gum has other surprising health benefits, at least the sugarless type. Rarely does sugar do any good.</p>

                <div class="card-image image33"></div>
                <p>A recent study has found that those who tend to stay up late and wake up later in the morning are mostly people with a high IQ. In other words, the more intelligent you are the more likely you are a night owl. Perhaps this was the origin of the old phrase-burning the midnight oil-as characterized by more intelligent people?</p>

                <div class="card-image image34"></div>
                <p>Don’t fret due to a lack of effective weight loss methods because the cure might be lying not so far from the proverbial ‘beyond your nose’. Scientists carried out a study involving 3.193 overweight people, mostly women, aged between 18 and 64. The participants were asked to inhale an array of ‘neutral’ sweet smells, a list of which included a banana, a green apple, peppermint and vanilla three times in each nostril whenever hunger pangs knocked home.</p>

                <div class="card-image image35"></div>
                <p>When someone has the fear of dolls, they are suffering from what is known as pediophobia. It is a relatively common fear and is believed to be a type of automatonophobia which itself is a fear of humanoid figures. Some individuals fear dolls and stuffed toys with others only fearing a certain type. The most common sources of fear include those that move or talk as well as old-fashioned china dolls.</p>

                <div class="card-image image36"></div>
                <p>Yup, that’s what NASA says. Back in 2008, the space agency commissioned a chemist and managing director of fragrance manufacturing company Omega Ingredients Mr. Steven Pearce, to recreate the smell of space in a lab. Te research was meant to be used to aid astronauts in preparing for the conditions they are likely to encounter in space. Pearce began working on the odor in august of that year and was looking to have come up with it by the end of the year.</p>

            	<h1>If the human eye were a digital camera, it would have 576 megapixels</h1>
                <div class="card-image image37"></div>
                <p>The average human retina has five million cone receptors on it. Since the cones are responsible for color vision, you might suppose that this equates to a five megapixel equivalent of the human eye. But there are also a hundred million rods that detect monochrome contrast, which plays an important role in the sharpness of the image you see. And even this 105MP is an underestimate because the eye is not a still camera.</p>

                <div class="card-image image38"></div>
                <p>Sounds preposterous? It’s not. It’s something that came from an actual experiment. Basically, when you are trying to unravel a puzzle, your brain is engineered to focus on what it considers relevant, and throws out the rest – connections or ideas that don’t look likely to help you arrive at the answer to your problem. That’s where the trick lies.</p>

                <div class="card-image image39"></div>
                <p>The occurrence of phosphenes can be spontaneous, and they can be provoked in a number of ways. They appear spontaneously only when visual stimuli are lacking and especially when the viewer is subjected to prolonged visual deprivation. Increasing the pressure on the eyeball produces more dramatic phosphenes.</p>

                <div class="card-image image40"></div>
                <p>Bad at maths? Gorge on chocolates before you attempt your next examination. A study from a few years back revealed that eating chocolate could improve the brain’s ability to do maths as well as boost your energy level. Researchers carried out the study in 2009 and found that flavanols, compounds found in chocolate and part of a group of chemicals called polyphenols, actually work by increasing the flow of blood into the brain.</p>

                <p>People who smoke marijuana generally tend to be thinner and are less likely to become obese, a study that involved 52,000 participants showed. A group of French researchers found that those who smoke pot on a regular basis are less likely to be obese than nonsmokers.</p>

                <p>A professor of medicine at Cheju National University School of Medicine in Korea Deokbae Park, PhD, published a paper that found asparagus to help lessen the hangover impact both prior to and after hitting the bottle. It helps in breaking down the acetaldehyde (the main culprit behind those pounding headaches) and ethanol. </p>

                <p>True story, try it. The subject continues to invite divided opinion on whether playing music to plants can actually benefit them. Evidence thus far suggests that plants do indeed respond in growth after being exposed to voice and music. That’s right – you should think of chatting up your lovely flowers.</p>

And there are indeed studies that have proven exposure to sarcasm enhances your creative problem solving abilities.</p>

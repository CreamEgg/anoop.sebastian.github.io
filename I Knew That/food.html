            	<h1>An apple in the morning has just as much caffeine as a cup of coffee</h1>
                <div class="card-image image20"></div>
                <p>When you’re asleep, the temperature of your body goes down slightly and so does your blood pressure. Getting back to normal levels does take some time, and this is the reason you get that slugging feeling when you first wake up.  Some get around it by smoking a cigarette, others a cup of coffee does the trick, and for some, an apple a day keeps the proverbial doctor away from the lethargy.  An average apple contains 12 percent of your recommended daily fiber intake, and 10 percent of the recommended dosage of vitamin C per day, not to mention minerals like calcium, potassium and manganese. It has been claimed that apples do contain caffeine, just like coffee.</p>

            	<h1>Coca-Cola originally contained small amounts of cocaine to give drinkers a buzz. It was removed in 1903.</h1>
                <div class="card-image image21"></div>
                <p>Coca-Cola was initially one of several drinks made from coca that claimed medicinal properties and other healing benefits. The early marketing campaigns by the soft drinks giant claimed that Coca-Cola – the drink – relieved headaches and acted as a sort of ‘brain and nerve tonic’.  The preparation involved coca leaves that gave the drink a small dose of cocaine which gave one a ‘buzz’ upon consumption. The politics of the day led to the company withdrawing cocaine from the formula, and instead used caffeine as the stimulating ingredient – and gone too were the medicinal claims.</p>

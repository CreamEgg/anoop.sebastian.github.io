                <p>You might want to thank a squirrel the next time you enjoy the shade of a tree. Millions of trees are accidentally planted by squirrels that bury nuts and then forget where they hid them.</p>

                <div class="card-image image11"></div>
                <p>Lions are the only felines that spend their lives in groups, each tasked with their own responsibility.
				The male’s responsibility is to protect the pride, and at times has an expansive area of over 100 sq. miles in which he patrols gallantly. The females are the ones who do the hunting, and mind you, the lioness is arguably the most efficient hunter in the animal kingdom </p>

                <p>There are many dog blood types you’ll find listed, and they are as many as 13 blood types! However, just 6 are the most commonly recognized. Dogs are classified as either positive or negative for each dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) which is basically a red blood cell in dogs.</p>

                <div class="card-image image13"></div>
                <p>Scientists have discovered polar bears can trace their family tree to Ireland. Genetic evidence shows they are descended from Irish brown bears that lived during the last Ace Age. Modern polar bears share a distinct DNA sequence, passed down the female line, with their now extinct brown ancestors. However, the same DNA fingerprint is absent from other species of brown bear alive today.</p>

                <div class="card-image image14"></div>
                <p>Keyring ornaments are perhaps the most useless item you’ll ever carry in your pocket or stuff in purse – but now, thanks to an increasingly popular item being sold in China, it can easily be the cruelest, too. For the price you might expect to pay for some kitschy trinket, Chinese street vendors are selling live animals, permanently sealed in a small plastic pouch where they can survive for a short while as someone’s conversation piece.</p>

                <div class="card-image image15"></div>
                <p>In a series of experiments, two dolphins used mirrors on the walls of their pools to examine carefully patterns drawn on their backs by animal psychologists. The tests provide the first evidence that the creatures are capable of self-awareness, a trait previously only seen in man and great apes. It also raises questions about the ethics of keeping in captivity for public amusement animals that can conceive of their own identity.</p>

                <div class="card-image image16"></div>
                <p>Take a close look at your cat or dog’s nose (a magnifying glass would probably be helpful), and you’ll see little bumps and ridges. Just like humans have fingerprints, cats and dogs have nose prints.</p>

                <div class="card-image image17"></div>
                <p>Do you know what results to that chalky-white mustache when you down a glass of refreshing ice-cold glass of milk? That’s the protein Casein. Rich in calcium, Casein helps contribute to milk’s white color. In addition, the cream that is found in milk contains white colored fat. The more cream in milk the more white it is.</p>

                <p>Spider silk may seem fragile, but it actually has a tensile strength that is a whopping five times more than steel! It nearly equals Kevlar in terms of strength, and Kevlar is the toughest polymer made by man.</p>

                <div class="card-image image19"></div>
                <p>There are almost two thousand known species of scorpions inhabiting six of the seven continents, and scorpions adapt to some of the most hostile environments in the world. One way these arthropods are able to accomplish this is through their ability to slow down their metabolic rate.</p>
